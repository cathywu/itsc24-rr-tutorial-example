# Car following simulation

>ðŸ“‹  A reproducible project example featuring traffic simulation with car following models and fundamental diagrams.

# Reproducibility in Transportation Research Tutorial

This repository is the official implementation for the ITSC 2024 [Reproducibility in Transportation Research: A Hands-on Tutorial](https://rrintransportation.github.io/itsc24-rr-tutorial/), Session 2 on *Documentation of Data and Code for Reproducibility*.

>ðŸ“‹ See the website for the accompanying lecture notes to this example, including step-by-step guidance.

## Requirements

Install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

>ðŸ“‹ **For Mac users with M1/M2 chips**: There are known issues with the "Apple Silicon" version of Anaconda. Please instead install the Intel version, even for M1/M2 chips. It is compatible for this project.

To install the Python requirements:

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate RR
```

## Run

To produce the fundamental diagrams in the tutorial, run this command:

```
python example/simulator.py --run-idm --no-render
```

The files are created under the `data` directory, and the figures under the `figures` directory.

To visualize the traffic simulation:
```
python example/simulator.py --run-idm
```

To save the traffic simulation into gif:
```
python example/simulator.py --run-idm --plot-gif
```

## Fundamental diagrams

The following are fundamental diagrams generated from single lane traffic modeled using the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM).
