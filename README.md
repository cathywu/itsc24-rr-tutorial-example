# Car following simulation

>ðŸ“‹  A reproducible project example featuring traffic simulation with car following models and fundamental diagrams.

# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation for the ITSC 2024 Tutorial [Reproducibility in Transportation Research: A Hands-on Tutorial](https://rrintransportation.github.io/itsc24-rr-tutorial/), Session 2 on *Documentation of Data and Code for Reproducibility*.

>ðŸ“‹ See the website for the accompanying lecture notes to this example, including step-by-step guidance.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate RR
```

## Run

To produce the fundamental diagrams in the tutorial, run this command:

```
python simulator.py --run-idm --no-render
```

## Fundamental diagrams

The following are fundamental diagrams generated from single lane traffic modeled using the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM).
